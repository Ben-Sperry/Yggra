## 6.4 Sharing Interface

The Sharing Interface enables controlled data sharing between users while maintaining privacy and security. This interface allows applications to create and manage secure views of personal data.

```python
class SharingManager:
    def create_share(self, data_selector: dict, 
                    recipient: str,
                    permissions: dict,
                    expiration: datetime) -> ShareToken:
        """Create a secure share of selected data.
        
        The data_selector defines what to share
        permissions specify allowed operations
        expiration sets when access should end
        """
        pass
    
    def accept_share(self, token: ShareToken) -> SharedView:
        """Accept and initialize access to shared data."""
        pass
    
    def revoke_share(self, token: ShareToken):
        """Immediately revoke access to shared data."""
        pass
    
    def list_active_shares(self) -> List[ShareInfo]:
        """List all active outgoing shares."""
        pass
```

Each interface includes comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring capabilities. The interfaces are designed to be:
- Intuitive for developers familiar with similar systems
- Safe by default, preventing common security mistakes
- Efficient for common operations
- Flexible enough to support advanced use cases
- Self-documenting through clear method names and parameters

The combination of these interfaces enables developers to build sophisticated applications while leveraging the full power of the personal graph system, all without needing to understand the internal complexity of the implementation.
