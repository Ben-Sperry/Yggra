# 9. Examples and Use Cases

## 9.1 Social Media Application

Let's examine how Yggra transforms the traditional social media experience by putting users in control of their data while enabling rich social interactions. Consider a decentralized social media application called "Connections."

When a user first launches Connections, instead of creating a new database, the application registers its data requirements with Yggra:

```python
class ConnectionsSchema:
    def __init__(self):
        self.content_types = {
            "Post": {
                "required": ["content", "timestamp", "author"],
                "optional": ["location", "mood", "attachments"],
                "relationships": ["comments", "reactions", "mentions"]
            },
            "Profile": {
                "required": ["display_name", "avatar"],
                "optional": ["bio", "interests", "location"],
                "relationships": ["follows", "blocks"]
            }
        }
```

The system then creates appropriate views by mapping these requirements to existing personal data. For instance, the Profile might reuse contact information already in the user's graph, while ensuring privacy through careful property mapping.

When the user creates a post, rather than sending it to a central server, the content becomes part of their personal graph:

```python
class Post:
    def create(self, content, attachments=None):
        # Store content in user's graph
        post_entity = graph.create_entity("Post")
        graph.add_statement(post_entity, "content", content)
        
        # Handle attachments through storage layer
        if attachments:
            for attachment in attachments:
                ref = storage.store(attachment.data)
                graph.add_statement(post_entity, "has_attachment", ref)
        
        # Create sharing view for followers
        share = sharing.create_view(post_entity, "followers")
        return share.public_url
```

What makes this approach powerful is how it enables new kinds of social interactions. For example, when someone comments on a post, their comment lives in their own graph but creates a relationship to the original post. This means users maintain ownership of their contributions while preserving the conversational context.
