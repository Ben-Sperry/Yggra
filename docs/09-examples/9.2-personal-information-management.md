## 9.2 Personal Information Management

Consider a personal information management system that helps users organize their lives across multiple domains. Instead of creating separate databases for different types of information, the system leverages Yggra's unified graph structure.

A task management application might interact with calendar events, contacts, and documents through a unified view:

```python
class PersonalOrganizerView:
    def create_task(self, task_data):
        # Create task entity
        task = graph.create_entity("Task")
        graph.add_statements([
            (task, "title", task_data.title),
            (task, "due_date", task_data.due_date)
        ])
        
        # Link to relevant entities
        if task_data.related_contact:
            contact = graph.find_entity("Contact", task_data.related_contact)
            graph.add_statement(task, "involves_person", contact)
            
        if task_data.related_document:
            doc = graph.find_entity("Document", task_data.related_document)
            graph.add_statement(task, "references", doc)
            
        return task

    def get_context(self, entity_id):
        # Retrieve rich context for any entity
        return graph.query()
            .starting_from(entity_id)
            .follow_relationships(["involves_person", "references"])
            .include_reverse_relationships()
            .execute()
```

This approach enables powerful features like automatic context gathering. When viewing a task, the system can show relevant emails, calendar events, and documents, all connected through the graph structure.
