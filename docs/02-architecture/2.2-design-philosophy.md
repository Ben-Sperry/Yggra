## 2.2 Design Philosophy

The architecture embodies several key philosophical principles:

### Separation of Concerns
Each layer has a single, well-defined responsibility. This separation allows components to evolve independently and optimizes each layer for its specific purpose.

### Information Hiding
Implementation details of each layer are hidden from the others. Applications need not understand graph structure, and the graph layer need not understand storage mechanisms.

### Data Independence
Applications are isolated from both the logical structure (graph) and physical storage of data. This independence allows the system to evolve without requiring application changes.

### Progressive Enhancement
The system can operate at different levels of sophistication:
- Basic: Simple file storage and retrieval
- Standard: Semantic data organization and querying
- Advanced: Complex relationship analysis and inference
