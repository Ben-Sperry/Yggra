# 10. Future Considerations

## 10.1 Extensibility Points

The Yggra system has been designed with several key extensibility points that enable future growth and adaptation. Understanding these extension mechanisms helps developers and organizations plan for future capabilities without compromising current functionality.

The storage layer can be extended to support new storage backends through the standardized interface. For instance, future implementations might include support for emerging decentralized storage systems or quantum-resistant encryption schemes. The system's abstraction of storage details means these can be added without disrupting existing applications:

```python
class QuantumResistentStorage(StorageBackend):
    def store(self, data: bytes, metadata: dict) -> StorageReference:
        # Implement post-quantum encryption
        encrypted_data = self.quantum_resistant_encrypt(data)
        location = self.distributed_store(encrypted_data)
        
        return StorageReference(
            location=location,
            encryption_scheme="quantum_resistant_lattice",
            verification_proof=self.generate_proof(data)
        )
```

The graph layer can be extended with new types of relationships and inference capabilities. As semantic technologies evolve, the system could incorporate more sophisticated reasoning abilities:

```python
class SemanticInferenceEngine:
    def derive_relationships(self, entity: Entity) -> List[Statement]:
        # Use ontological reasoning
        direct_statements = self.graph.get_statements(entity)
        inferred = self.reasoner.infer_implications(direct_statements)
        
        # Validate and score inferences
        validated = self.validate_inferences(inferred)
        
        return validated
```
