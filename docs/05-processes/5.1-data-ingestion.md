# 5. Core Processes

## 5.1 Data Ingestion

The data ingestion process handles how information enters the system, ensuring it is properly decomposed, stored, and indexed. This process must maintain data integrity while handling various input formats and sources.

When data enters the system, it follows a carefully orchestrated sequence:

First, the application interface layer receives the data in its native format. For example, a photo management application might submit an image file along with metadata like date, location, and tags. The interface layer examines this input using the appropriate data structure interpreter, which understands the application's schema and expected format.

Next, the interpreter decomposes the input into its constituent parts. In our photo example, this would separate the image file from its metadata. The system analyzes the image file to determine its characteristics (size, format, hash) and creates a storage reference. Meanwhile, the metadata is transformed into a set of statements about the new entity representing the photo.

The storage layer then takes responsibility for the binary data. It examines the file's characteristics and consults its strategy manager to determine the optimal storage approach. A large photo that's frequently accessed might be stored locally for performance, while rarely accessed photos might be moved to more cost-effective storage.

Finally, the graph layer records the statements that represent the photo and its relationships. These statements might include:
- The photo's creation date
- Its storage reference
- Location information
- Relationships to people or events
- Technical metadata like camera settings
- User-added tags or descriptions

The ingestion process maintains several important guarantees:
- Atomicity: All components of the data are stored successfully, or none are
- Consistency: All relationships and constraints remain valid
- Durability: Once acknowledged, data is permanently recorded
- Integrity: Data cannot be corrupted or partially stored
