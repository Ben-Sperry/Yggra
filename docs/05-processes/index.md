# 5. Core Processes

## 5.1 Data Ingestion

The data ingestion process handles how information enters the system, ensuring it is properly decomposed, stored, and indexed. This process must maintain data integrity while handling various input formats and sources.

When data enters the system, it follows a carefully orchestrated sequence:

First, the application interface layer receives the data in its native format. For example, a photo management application might submit an image file along with metadata like date, location, and tags. The interface layer examines this input using the appropriate data structure interpreter, which understands the application's schema and expected format.

Next, the interpreter decomposes the input into its constituent parts. In our photo example, this would separate the image file from its metadata. The system analyzes the image file to determine its characteristics (size, format, hash) and creates a storage reference. Meanwhile, the metadata is transformed into a set of statements about the new entity representing the photo.

The storage layer then takes responsibility for the binary data. It examines the file's characteristics and consults its strategy manager to determine the optimal storage approach. A large photo that's frequently accessed might be stored locally for performance, while rarely accessed photos might be moved to more cost-effective storage.

Finally, the graph layer records the statements that represent the photo and its relationships. These statements might include:
- The photo's creation date
- Its storage reference
- Location information
- Relationships to people or events
- Technical metadata like camera settings
- User-added tags or descriptions

The ingestion process maintains several important guarantees:
- Atomicity: All components of the data are stored successfully, or none are
- Consistency: All relationships and constraints remain valid
- Durability: Once acknowledged, data is permanently recorded
- Integrity: Data cannot be corrupted or partially stored

## 5.2 View Generation

View generation is the process of creating and maintaining application-specific representations of graph data. This process transforms the atomic statements of the graph into structures that applications can easily consume.

The view generation process begins when an application registers its schema with the system. The schema defines what data the application needs and how it expects that data to be structured. The system analyzes this schema to create an efficient strategy for maintaining the view.

When generating a view, the system:
1. Identifies relevant statements in the graph based on the schema
2. Resolves any reference chains needed to construct the view
3. Transforms data into the required format
4. Applies any specified filters or transformations
5. Caches the results for future use

View maintenance happens continuously as new data enters the system. When the graph receives new statements, the view maintenance process:
1. Determines which views might be affected by the new data
2. Updates only the affected portions of each view
3. Notifies applications if their view has changed
4. Maintains cache consistency

## 5.3 Query Processing

Query processing transforms application requests into efficient graph operations while maintaining privacy and access controls. This process bridges the gap between application-level concepts and graph-level representations.

The query process follows several stages:

Planning Stage:
- Analyzes the query requirements
- Identifies relevant graph patterns
- Develops an execution strategy
- Estimates resource requirements

Execution Stage:
- Traverses the graph efficiently
- Applies filters and transformations
- Aggregates results as needed
- Handles pagination and streaming

Post-processing Stage:
- Formats results according to view requirements
- Applies privacy transformations
- Validates access permissions
- Prepares response metadata

## 5.4 Data Sharing

The data sharing process enables controlled access to personal data while maintaining privacy and security. This process creates secure, temporary views that other users can access through their applications.

When a user initiates sharing, the system:
1. Creates a new view definition based on sharing parameters
2. Applies specified privacy transformations
3. Generates access credentials
4. Records sharing metadata in the graph
5. Establishes monitoring for access patterns

The shared view maintains several properties:
- Independence: Changes to sharing don't affect the underlying data
- Revocability: Access can be removed at any time
- Granularity: Sharing can be controlled at the property level
- Auditability: All access is logged and can be reviewed

## 5.5 Storage Management

Storage management continuously optimizes data placement and access patterns while maintaining security and efficiency. This process handles the physical storage of data across different backends.

The storage management process includes:

Placement Optimization:
- Analyzes access patterns
- Predicts future usage
- Balances performance and cost
- Manages storage quotas

Data Migration:
- Moves data between storage backends
- Handles format transitions
- Maintains accessibility during moves
- Updates references automatically

Integrity Management:
- Verifies data integrity
- Manages replicas
- Handles corruption recovery
- Maintains backup consistency

This process operates continuously, adapting to changing usage patterns and system conditions while maintaining strict consistency and security guarantees.
