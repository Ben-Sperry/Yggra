# 7. Implementation Considerations

## 7.1 Performance Requirements

Performance in Yggra must be considered across multiple dimensions, as the system needs to handle both interactive usage and background processing efficiently.

Query Performance must meet interactive application needs. The system achieves this through several mechanisms:

The view generation system maintains materialized views for common access patterns. When an application registers its schema, the system analyzes the required access patterns and creates appropriate indexes and cache structures. This means that while the first load of an application might take longer as views are generated, subsequent access becomes nearly instantaneous.

For example, a photo management application might declare that it frequently needs to access photos by date and location. The system would then maintain indexes for these access patterns:

```python
class PhotoAppAccess:
    def __init__(self):
        self.access_patterns = {
            "primary": [
                ("date_taken", "descending"),
                ("location", "geohash")
            ],
            "secondary": [
                "album",
                "people_tags"
            ]
        }
```

Storage performance is optimized through intelligent data placement. The system continuously monitors access patterns and adjusts storage placement accordingly. Frequently accessed data might be kept in local storage, while rarely accessed data could be moved to more cost-effective storage solutions.

Graph traversal performance is maintained through careful index management and query optimization. The system maintains specialized indexes for common relationship patterns and uses query planning to minimize graph traversals.

## 7.2 Security Requirements

Security in Yggra must be comprehensive yet unobtrusive. The system implements security at multiple levels:

At the storage level, all data is encrypted at rest using strong encryption. The system maintains a hierarchy of encryption keys:
- Master keys for the overall system
- Content-specific keys for different data categories
- Sharing keys for controlled data access

The graph layer implements fine-grained access control:
- Entity-level permissions
- Property-level visibility rules
- Relationship-based access constraints
- Temporal access boundaries

Application access is controlled through a capability-based security model:
- Applications receive specific capabilities rather than general access
- Capabilities can be fine-tuned to specific data needs
- Access can be revoked at any time
- All access is logged for audit purposes

## 7.3 Privacy Requirements

Privacy is fundamental to Yggra's design and implementation. The system ensures privacy through several mechanisms:

Data minimization ensures that applications only receive the data they genuinely need. When an application requests access, the system analyzes its requirements and provides the minimum necessary information:
```python
class PrivacyFilter:
    def filter_view(self, view_data, privacy_policy):
        # Remove unnecessary sensitive fields
        # Apply data transformation rules
        # Enforce minimal disclosure
        # Log access patterns
```

Property-level privacy controls allow users to specify detailed privacy preferences:
- Which properties can be shared
- Under what circumstances
- With whom
- For how long

The sharing system implements privacy-preserving views:
- Data transformations to remove sensitive information
- Aggregation to protect individual records
- Differential privacy for statistical queries
- Time-limited access controls

## 7.4 Scalability Considerations

Yggra must scale both in terms of data volume and complexity of relationships. The system addresses scalability through several strategies:

Vertical scaling of the graph layer:
- Efficient memory usage through careful data structures
- Optimized graph traversal algorithms
- Smart caching of frequently accessed paths
- Incremental view updates

Horizontal scaling of storage:
- Distributed storage across multiple backends
- Intelligent data placement based on access patterns
- Automatic migration between storage tiers
- Efficient handling of large binary objects

Application scaling:
- Independent view maintenance for each application
- Parallel query processing
- Batch operations for bulk data handling
- Resource isolation between applications

## 7.5 Distribution Model

The distribution model in Yggra balances personal data sovereignty with efficient data sharing. The system implements this through several mechanisms:

Node Management handles the distributed nature of personal graphs:
- Each user maintains their own graph node
- Nodes can operate independently
- Nodes can sync when connected
- Privacy is maintained during synchronization

The CRDT implementation ensures consistency:
- All operations are eventually consistent
- Conflicts are resolved deterministically
- History is preserved
- Local operations remain fast

Communication between nodes is secure and efficient:
- End-to-end encryption for all transfers
- Bandwidth-efficient sync protocols
- Partial sync capabilities
- Offline operation support

The system handles various network conditions:
```python
class NodeSync:
    def sync_strategy(self, network_quality):
        if network_quality.bandwidth > HIGH_BANDWIDTH:
            return FullSync()
        elif network_quality.bandwidth > LOW_BANDWIDTH:
            return DeltaSync()
        else:
            return PrioritizedSync()
```

Each of these considerations has been carefully designed to ensure that Yggra can operate effectively in real-world conditions while maintaining its core principles of personal data sovereignty and efficient data sharing.
