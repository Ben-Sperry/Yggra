## 7.2 Security Requirements

Security in Yggra must be comprehensive yet unobtrusive. The system implements security at multiple levels:

At the storage level, all data is encrypted at rest using strong encryption. The system maintains a hierarchy of encryption keys:
- Master keys for the overall system
- Content-specific keys for different data categories
- Sharing keys for controlled data access

The graph layer implements fine-grained access control:
- Entity-level permissions
- Property-level visibility rules
- Relationship-based access constraints
- Temporal access boundaries

Application access is controlled through a capability-based security model:
- Applications receive specific capabilities rather than general access
- Capabilities can be fine-tuned to specific data needs
- Access can be revoked at any time
- All access is logged for audit purposes
