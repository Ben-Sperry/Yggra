## 4.5 Storage Reference Model

Storage references create an abstraction layer between the graph layer and physical storage. They contain all information needed to locate and validate stored data without exposing storage implementation details.

```python
class StorageReference:
    id: UUID                # Reference identifier
    content_hash: str       # Data integrity hash
    size: int              # Content size in bytes
    mime_type: str         # Content type
    encryption_info: Dict  # Encryption metadata
    location: Dict         # Backend-specific location info
    
    # Performance optimization
    access_pattern: Dict   # Usage statistics
    replicas: List[str]    # Replica locations
    
    # Security
    access_control: Dict   # Permission information
    audit_log: List       # Access history
```

This model enables:
- Location-independent data access
- Transparent encryption
- Integrity verification
- Access control at the storage level
- Performance optimization through replication

The storage reference model is particularly important as it allows the system to optimize data placement and access patterns without requiring changes to the graph layer or application interfaces. Combined with intelligent storage management policies, this enables efficient handling of both small metadata and large binary objects while maintaining a consistent interface for all data types.
