## 4.4 Application View Model

Application views provide a bridge between the graph's statement-based model and application-specific data structures. A view definition includes both the structure of the expected data and rules for translating between graph and application representations.

```python
class ViewSchema:
    name: str                    # Unique view identifier
    version: str                 # Schema version
    structure: Dict             # Expected data structure
    property_mappings: Dict     # Graph to app field mappings
    constraints: List[Rule]     # Data validation rules
    update_policy: UpdatePolicy # How changes are handled
    cache_policy: CachePolicy  # View maintenance rules
```

View schemas support:
- Multiple versions of the same basic structure
- Flexible property mapping
- Constraint validation
- Update and cache policy specification
