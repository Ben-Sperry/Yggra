# 3. Core Components

## 3.1 Storage Layer

The storage layer provides a unified interface for managing physical data storage across different backends while maintaining data privacy and efficiency. This layer abstracts the complexities of different storage systems, allowing the rest of the system to interact with stored data through a consistent interface.

### Storage Backend Interface

The storage layer defines a standard interface that all storage backends must implement:

```python
class StorageBackend:
    def store(self, data: bytes, metadata: Dict) -> StorageReference:
        """Store data and return a reference to its location"""
        pass
        
    def retrieve(self, reference: StorageReference) -> bytes:
        """Retrieve data using its storage reference"""
        pass
        
    def verify(self, reference: StorageReference) -> bool:
        """Verify data integrity using stored hashes"""
        pass
        
    def replicate(self, reference: StorageReference, strategy: ReplicationStrategy):
        """Create additional copies according to strategy"""
        pass
```

### Storage Strategy Management

The storage layer implements intelligent data placement through a strategy manager that considers:

- Data sensitivity (determining encryption requirements)
- Access patterns (affecting storage location)
- Size and format (influencing storage backend selection)
- Replication needs (determining backup strategy)
- Cost considerations (balancing performance and resource usage)

The strategy manager continuously evaluates and optimizes data placement, potentially moving data between backends as usage patterns change.

### Data Integrity and Verification

Each stored object maintains:
- Content-based identifier (e.g., hash)
- Integrity metadata
- Access history
- Encryption details
- Backend-specific metadata

## 3.2 Graph Layer

The graph layer maintains the semantic structure of a user's personal data through an immutable statement store and sophisticated query capabilities.

### Entity Management

Entities are the fundamental units of the graph and represent anything that can have properties or relationships:

```python
class Entity:
    def __init__(self, id: UUID):
        self.id = id
        self.created_at = datetime.now()
        self.statements = []  # References to statements about this entity
        self.metadata = {}    # System-level metadata
```

### Statement Management

Statements are immutable facts about entities:

```python
class Statement:
    def __init__(self, subject: UUID, predicate: UUID, object: Any):
        self.id = uuid4()
        self.subject = subject
        self.predicate = predicate
        self.object = object
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()
        self.provenance = {}  # Track statement origin
        self.certainty = 1.0  # Confidence level
```

The statement store handles:
- Statement validation
- Temporal ordering
- Conflict resolution through CRDT rules
- Relationship maintenance
- Query optimization

### CRDT Implementation

The graph layer uses a hybrid CRDT approach that combines:
- Add-only sets for basic statements
- Last-write-wins registers for system metadata
- Vector clocks for temporal ordering
- Merkle trees for efficient synchronization

## 3.3 Application Interface Layer

The application interface layer translates between application-specific data structures and the graph representation.

### Data Structure Interpreters

Each supported data structure type has an interpreter that handles bidirectional translation:

```python
class DataStructureInterpreter:
    def to_graph(self, data: Any) -> List[Statement]:
        """Convert application data to graph statements"""
        pass
        
    def from_graph(self, statements: List[Statement]) -> Any:
        """Convert graph statements to application data structure"""
        pass
```

Built-in interpreters support common formats:
- Relational databases (SQL)
- Document stores (JSON)
- Key-value stores
- File systems
- Object structures

### View Generation and Management

Views provide applications with their preferred data structure while maintaining consistency with the graph:

```python
class ApplicationView:
    def __init__(self, schema: Schema, interpreter: DataStructureInterpreter):
        self.schema = schema
        self.interpreter = interpreter
        self.cache = {}
        self.update_log = []
        
    def refresh(self):
        """Update view from graph changes"""
        pass
        
    def commit(self, changes: Any):
        """Commit application changes to graph"""
        pass
```

### Application Schema Management

Applications declare their data requirements through schemas that specify:
- Required entity types
- Property mappings
- Relationship requirements
- Update policies
- Caching strategies

## 3.4 Data Sharing System

The data sharing system enables controlled access to personal data through secure views.

### View-Based Sharing

Shared views are created through a view definition that specifies:
- Included entities and properties
- Access permissions
- Temporal constraints
- Update policies
- Privacy transformations

### Access Control

Access control is implemented at multiple levels:
- View level (what data is accessible)
- Property level (what attributes are visible)
- Operation level (what actions are permitted)
- Temporal level (when access is allowed)

### Privacy Management

Privacy is maintained through:
- Differential privacy techniques for aggregate data
- Property-level access control
- Data transformation pipelines
- Access auditing and revocation
- Secure view implementation
