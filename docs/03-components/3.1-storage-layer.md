# 3. Core Components

## 3.1 Storage Layer

The storage layer provides a unified interface for managing physical data storage across different backends while maintaining data privacy and efficiency. This layer abstracts the complexities of different storage systems, allowing the rest of the system to interact with stored data through a consistent interface.

### Storage Backend Interface

The storage layer defines a standard interface that all storage backends must implement:

```python
class StorageBackend:
    def store(self, data: bytes, metadata: Dict) -> StorageReference:
        """Store data and return a reference to its location"""
        pass
        
    def retrieve(self, reference: StorageReference) -> bytes:
        """Retrieve data using its storage reference"""
        pass
        
    def verify(self, reference: StorageReference) -> bool:
        """Verify data integrity using stored hashes"""
        pass
        
    def replicate(self, reference: StorageReference, strategy: ReplicationStrategy):
        """Create additional copies according to strategy"""
        pass
```

### Storage Strategy Management

The storage layer implements intelligent data placement through a strategy manager that considers:

- Data sensitivity (determining encryption requirements)
- Access patterns (affecting storage location)
- Size and format (influencing storage backend selection)
- Replication needs (determining backup strategy)
- Cost considerations (balancing performance and resource usage)

The strategy manager continuously evaluates and optimizes data placement, potentially moving data between backends as usage patterns change.

### Data Integrity and Verification

Each stored object maintains:
- Content-based identifier (e.g., hash)
- Integrity metadata
- Access history
- Encryption details
- Backend-specific metadata
