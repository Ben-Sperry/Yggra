## 3.2 Graph Layer

The graph layer maintains the semantic structure of a user's personal data through an immutable statement store and sophisticated query capabilities.

### Entity Management

Entities are the fundamental units of the graph and represent anything that can have properties or relationships:

```python
class Entity:
    def __init__(self, id: UUID):
        self.id = id
        self.created_at = datetime.now()
        self.statements = []  # References to statements about this entity
        self.metadata = {}    # System-level metadata
```

### Statement Management

Statements are immutable facts about entities:

```python
class Statement:
    def __init__(self, subject: UUID, predicate: UUID, object: Any):
        self.id = uuid4()
        self.subject = subject
        self.predicate = predicate
        self.object = object
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()
        self.provenance = {}  # Track statement origin
        self.certainty = 1.0  # Confidence level
```

The statement store handles:
- Statement validation
- Temporal ordering
- Conflict resolution through CRDT rules
- Relationship maintenance
- Query optimization

### CRDT Implementation

The graph layer uses a hybrid CRDT approach that combines:
- Add-only sets for basic statements
- Last-write-wins registers for system metadata
- Vector clocks for temporal ordering
- Merkle trees for efficient synchronization
