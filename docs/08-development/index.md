# 8. Development and Deployment

## 8.1 Development Guidelines

When developing applications for Yggra, developers should follow certain principles and practices to ensure their applications work effectively within the personal data ecosystem. These guidelines help create applications that respect user privacy while taking full advantage of the system's capabilities.

First and foremost, developers should embrace the principle of data independence. Rather than creating private data stores, applications should declare their data requirements through schemas. For example, instead of creating a custom database for a task management application, you might declare your needs like this:

```python
# Define the data structure you need
class TaskManagerSchema:
    def __init__(self):
        self.requirements = {
            "entities": {
                "Task": {
                    "required_properties": ["title", "due_date", "status"],
                    "optional_properties": ["description", "tags", "priority"]
                },
                "Project": {
                    "required_properties": ["name"],
                    "optional_properties": ["description", "deadline"]
                }
            },
            "relationships": {
                "task_project": ["Task", "Project"],
                "task_dependency": ["Task", "Task"]
            }
        }
```

The system will then provide appropriate interfaces based on these requirements, potentially reusing existing data and relationships from other applications when appropriate.

Developers should also follow these key practices:
- Use the highest-level interface that meets your needs
- Implement graceful degradation when optional data is unavailable
- Respect user privacy preferences in your application logic
- Design for eventual consistency in data updates
- Plan for offline operation when possible

## 8.2 Testing Strategy

Testing applications built on Yggra requires consideration of both the application logic and its interaction with the personal data ecosystem. A comprehensive testing strategy should include several layers:

Unit Testing should focus on application logic independent of data access:
```python
def test_task_priority_calculation(self):
    # Test the application's business logic
    task = Task(due_date=tomorrow, dependencies=3)
    priority = calculate_priority(task)
    self.assertEqual(priority, "high")
```

Integration Testing should verify correct interaction with the Yggra interfaces:
```python
def test_task_creation_and_retrieval(self):
    # Test interaction with the system
    schema = TaskManagerSchema()
    view = system.create_view(schema)
    
    # Create a task through the view
    task_id = view.create_task({"title": "Test Task"})
    
    # Verify it can be retrieved
    retrieved = view.get_task(task_id)
    self.assertEqual(retrieved.title, "Test Task")
```

Privacy Testing should verify that your application respects user preferences:
```python
def test_privacy_compliance(self):
    # Test with restricted permissions
    restricted_view = system.create_view(schema, privacy_level="strict")
    
    # Verify application handles missing optional data
    task = restricted_view.get_task(task_id)
    self.assertTrue(task.handle_missing_properties())
```

## 8.3 Deployment Models

Yggra supports several deployment models to accommodate different user needs and organizational requirements. Each model maintains the core principle of personal data sovereignty while adapting to specific contexts.

Personal Deployment represents the simplest case:
- Single user operates their own node
- Data stored locally or in personal cloud storage
- Applications interact directly with the personal node
- Sharing through controlled views to other users

Organizational Deployment supports multiple users while maintaining individual data sovereignty:
- Each user maintains their own graph
- Shared storage infrastructure for efficiency
- Organizational policies applied through view systems
- Centralized management of application deployment

Hybrid Deployment combines personal and organizational needs:
- Personal data remains under individual control
- Organizational data shared through managed views
- Clear boundaries between personal and shared data
- Flexible application deployment options

## 8.4 Migration Strategies

Moving existing applications and data to Yggra requires careful planning to ensure smooth transition while maintaining data integrity and application functionality.

Data Migration follows a staged approach:
1. Analysis Phase
   - Map existing data structures to graph representation
   - Identify data relationships and dependencies
   - Plan privacy and sharing requirements

2. Translation Phase
   - Convert existing data to graph statements
   - Maintain reference integrity
   - Preserve metadata and history

3. Validation Phase
   - Verify data completeness
   - Check relationship consistency
   - Confirm privacy constraints

Application Migration can follow several patterns:

Parallel Operation allows gradual transition:
```python
class HybridDataAccess:
    def get_data(self, id):
        # Try new system first
        try:
            return yggra_view.get_data(id)
        except NotMigrated:
            return legacy_system.get_data(id)
```

Incremental Feature Migration enables staged rollout:
```python
class FeatureManager:
    def use_new_system_for_feature(self, feature):
        return (feature in migrated_features and 
                user_opts_in(feature))
```

These migration strategies ensure continuous operation while moving toward full Yggra integration. The system's flexibility allows organizations to maintain existing workflows while gradually adopting new capabilities.
