# Appendix D: Security Model

## Security Philosophy

The Yggra security model is built on the principle that security should be comprehensive yet unobtrusive. Security measures are implemented at every layer of the system, creating defense in depth while maintaining usability. The model recognizes that personal data requires both strong technical protections and careful attention to user intent and privacy preferences.

## Threat Model

The system considers several categories of threats:

### External Threats
The system must protect against unauthorized access attempts from outside actors, including:
- Network-based attacks attempting to intercept or modify data
- Unauthorized access attempts to stored data
- Attempts to impersonate legitimate users or applications
- Denial of service attacks against system components

### Internal Threats
The system must also protect against potential misuse by authorized users:
- Applications exceeding their granted permissions
- Accidental data exposure through misconfigured sharing
- Unintended data correlation across facets
- Resource exhaustion from poorly designed queries

### Social Engineering
The system includes protections against social engineering attacks:
- Phishing attempts to gain access to shared facets
- Attempts to trick users into oversharing data
- Manipulation of sharing settings
- Impersonation of trusted applications

## Security Architecture

### Key Management

The system implements a hierarchical key management system:

```python
class KeyHierarchy:
    """
    Manages the system's encryption keys at different levels.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.master_key = None        # Root key for the system
        self.storage_keys = {}        # Keys for storage backends
        self.facet_keys = {}         # Keys for individual facets
        self.sharing_keys = {}       # Keys for shared facets
        
    def derive_key(self, purpose: str, context: Dict) -> EncryptionKey:
        """
        Derives a purpose-specific key using the master key and context.
        Keys are derived rather than stored where possible.
        """
        if purpose == "storage":
            return self._derive_storage_key(context)
        elif purpose == "facet":
            return self._derive_facet_key(context)
        elif purpose == "sharing":
            return self._derive_sharing_key(context)
            
    def rotate_key(self, key_id: UUID):
        """
        Implements key rotation without disrupting system operation.
        """
        # Create new key version
        new_key = self._generate_key()
        
        # Re-encrypt data using new key
        self._migrate_data(old_key, new_key)
        
        # Update key references
        self._update_key_references(key_id, new_key)
```

### Authentication and Authorization

The system implements a capability-based security model:

```python
class Capability:
    """
    Represents a specific permission granted to an application or user.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.id = uuid4()
        self.grants = set()           # Allowed operations
        self.restrictions = set()     # Explicit denials
        self.context = {}            # Additional constraints
        self.expiration = None       # Optional expiration time
        
    def can_access(self, operation: str, context: Dict) -> bool:
        """
        Checks if this capability allows a specific operation.
        """
        if self.is_expired():
            return False
            
        if operation in self.restrictions:
            return False
            
        if operation in self.grants:
            return self._check_context(context)
            
        return False
```

### Data Protection

Data protection occurs at multiple levels:

1. At Rest:
```python
class StorageProtection:
    """
    Manages encryption of stored data.
    """
    def protect_data(self, data: bytes, context: Dict) -> ProtectedData:
        """
        Encrypts data for storage with appropriate keys.
        """
        # Select encryption scheme based on sensitivity
        scheme = self._select_scheme(context)
        
        # Generate data key
        data_key = self._generate_data_key()
        
        # Encrypt data
        encrypted = scheme.encrypt(data, data_key)
        
        # Encrypt data key with master key
        wrapped_key = self._wrap_key(data_key)
        
        return ProtectedData(
            ciphertext=encrypted,
            wrapped_key=wrapped_key,
            scheme=scheme.identifier
        )
```

2. In Transit:
```python
class TransitProtection:
    """
    Manages protection of data during transmission.
    """
    def protect_stream(self, 
                      data_stream: Iterator[bytes],
                      context: Dict) -> ProtectedStream:
        """
        Encrypts a stream of data for transmission.
        """
        # Establish secure channel
        channel = self._create_secure_channel(context)
        
        # Set up streaming encryption
        encryptor = channel.create_encryptor()
        
        # Process stream
        for chunk in data_stream:
            yield encryptor.update(chunk)
            
        # Finalize
        yield encryptor.finalize()
```

3. During Processing:
```python
class ProcessingProtection:
    """
    Manages protection of data during processing.
    """
    def secure_computation(self, 
                         operation: Callable,
                         protected_data: ProtectedData) -> ProtectedData:
        """
        Performs computation on encrypted data where possible.
        Falls back to secure enclave when necessary.
        """
        if self._supports_homomorphic(operation):
            return self._homomorphic_compute(operation, protected_data)
        else:
            return self._enclave_compute(operation, protected_data)
```

### Access Control

Access control is implemented through a combination of mechanisms:

```python
class AccessControl:
    """
    Manages access control decisions.
    """
    def check_access(self, 
                    subject: Identity,
                    operation: Operation,
                    resource: Resource) -> bool:
        """
        Determines if access should be granted.
        """
        # Check capabilities
        if not subject.has_capability(operation, resource):
            return False
            
        # Check context
        if not self._check_context(subject, operation, resource):
            return False
            
        # Check privacy policies
        if not self._check_privacy_policies(subject, operation, resource):
            return False
            
        # Check sharing constraints
        if not self._check_sharing_constraints(subject, operation, resource):
            return False
            
        return True
```

## Security Monitoring and Auditing

The system maintains comprehensive audit logs:

```python
class SecurityAuditor:
    """
    Manages security monitoring and auditing.
    """
    def log_security_event(self, event: SecurityEvent):
        """
        Records security-relevant events.
        """
        # Record event details
        self.event_log.append(event)
        
        # Check for anomalies
        if self._is_anomalous(event):
            self._raise_alert(event)
            
        # Update statistics
        self._update_stats(event)
```

## Incident Response

The system includes mechanisms for responding to security incidents:

1. Automatic response to detected threats
2. Capability revocation
3. Emergency key rotation
4. Audit trail analysis
5. User notification

The security model is continuously evolving, with regular updates to address new threats and incorporate improved security measures. All security mechanisms are subject to regular audit and testing to ensure their effectiveness.
