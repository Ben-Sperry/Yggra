## 3.3 Application Interface Layer

The application interface layer translates between application-specific data structures and the graph representation.

### Data Structure Interpreters

Each supported data structure type has an interpreter that handles bidirectional translation:

```python
class DataStructureInterpreter:
    def to_graph(self, data: Any) -> List[Statement]:
        """Convert application data to graph statements"""
        pass
        
    def from_graph(self, statements: List[Statement]) -> Any:
        """Convert graph statements to application data structure"""
        pass
```

Built-in interpreters support common formats:
- Relational databases (SQL)
- Document stores (JSON)
- Key-value stores
- File systems
- Object structures

### View Generation and Management

Views provide applications with their preferred data structure while maintaining consistency with the graph:

```python
class ApplicationView:
    def __init__(self, schema: Schema, interpreter: DataStructureInterpreter):
        self.schema = schema
        self.interpreter = interpreter
        self.cache = {}
        self.update_log = []
        
    def refresh(self):
        """Update view from graph changes"""
        pass
        
    def commit(self, changes: Any):
        """Commit application changes to graph"""
        pass
```

### Application Schema Management

Applications declare their data requirements through schemas that specify:
- Required entity types
- Property mappings
- Relationship requirements
- Update policies
- Caching strategies
