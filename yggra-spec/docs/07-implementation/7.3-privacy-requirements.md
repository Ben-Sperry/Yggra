## 7.3 Privacy Requirements

Privacy is fundamental to Yggra's design and implementation. The system ensures privacy through several mechanisms:

Data minimization ensures that applications only receive the data they genuinely need. When an application requests access, the system analyzes its requirements and provides the minimum necessary information:
```python
class PrivacyFilter:
    def filter_view(self, view_data, privacy_policy):
        # Remove unnecessary sensitive fields
        # Apply data transformation rules
        # Enforce minimal disclosure
        # Log access patterns
```

Property-level privacy controls allow users to specify detailed privacy preferences:
- Which properties can be shared
- Under what circumstances
- With whom
- For how long

The sharing system implements privacy-preserving views:
- Data transformations to remove sensitive information
- Aggregation to protect individual records
- Differential privacy for statistical queries
- Time-limited access controls
