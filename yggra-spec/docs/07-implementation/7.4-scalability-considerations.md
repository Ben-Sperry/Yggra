## 7.4 Scalability Considerations

Yggra must scale both in terms of data volume and complexity of relationships. The system addresses scalability through several strategies:

Vertical scaling of the graph layer:
- Efficient memory usage through careful data structures
- Optimized graph traversal algorithms
- Smart caching of frequently accessed paths
- Incremental view updates

Horizontal scaling of storage:
- Distributed storage across multiple backends
- Intelligent data placement based on access patterns
- Automatic migration between storage tiers
- Efficient handling of large binary objects

Application scaling:
- Independent view maintenance for each application
- Parallel query processing
- Batch operations for bulk data handling
- Resource isolation between applications
