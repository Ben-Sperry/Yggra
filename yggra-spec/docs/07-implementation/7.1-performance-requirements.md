# 7. Implementation Considerations

## 7.1 Performance Requirements

Performance in Yggra must be considered across multiple dimensions, as the system needs to handle both interactive usage and background processing efficiently.

Query Performance must meet interactive application needs. The system achieves this through several mechanisms:

The view generation system maintains materialized views for common access patterns. When an application registers its schema, the system analyzes the required access patterns and creates appropriate indexes and cache structures. This means that while the first load of an application might take longer as views are generated, subsequent access becomes nearly instantaneous.

For example, a photo management application might declare that it frequently needs to access photos by date and location. The system would then maintain indexes for these access patterns:

```python
class PhotoAppAccess:
    def __init__(self):
        self.access_patterns = {
            "primary": [
                ("date_taken", "descending"),
                ("location", "geohash")
            ],
            "secondary": [
                "album",
                "people_tags"
            ]
        }
```

Storage performance is optimized through intelligent data placement. The system continuously monitors access patterns and adjusts storage placement accordingly. Frequently accessed data might be kept in local storage, while rarely accessed data could be moved to more cost-effective storage solutions.

Graph traversal performance is maintained through careful index management and query optimization. The system maintains specialized indexes for common relationship patterns and uses query planning to minimize graph traversals.
