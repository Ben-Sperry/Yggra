## 9.4 Data Analysis

The data analysis use case shows how Yggra enables personal analytics while maintaining privacy. Users can analyze their data across different applications while maintaining complete control over what insights are shared.

A personal analytics application might track health data across multiple sources:

```python
class HealthAnalytics:
    def analyze_health_trends(self, date_range):
        # Gather data from various sources
        health_data = graph.query()
            .find_type("HealthMetric")
            .in_time_range(date_range)
            .include_related("Activity", "Sleep", "Nutrition")
            .execute()
            
        # Perform analysis while maintaining privacy
        insights = analyze_private(health_data)
        
        # Create shareable summary
        summary_view = sharing.create_view({
            "data": insights,
            "level": "aggregate_only",
            "minimum_group_size": 10
        })
        
        return summary_view
```

This enables users to gain insights from their data while maintaining granular control over what information is shared with healthcare providers or research studies.
