## 6.3 Query Interface

The Query Interface provides a way to search and analyze data across the graph while maintaining privacy boundaries and access controls. This interface supports both simple lookups and complex graph traversals.

The query interface uses a fluent API design for readability and composability:

```python
class GraphQuery:
    def starting_from(self, entity_type: str) -> 'GraphQuery':
        """Begin query from entities of a specific type."""
        pass
    
    def following(self, relationship: str) -> 'GraphQuery':
        """Follow relationships between entities."""
        pass
    
    def where(self, conditions: dict) -> 'GraphQuery':
        """Filter results based on property values."""
        pass
    
    def select(self, properties: List[str]) -> 'GraphQuery':
        """Specify which properties to return."""
        pass
    
    def execute(self) -> QueryResult:
        """Execute the query and return results."""
        pass

# Example usage
results = graph.query()\
    .starting_from("Contact")\
    .following("member_of")\
    .where({"group_name": "Family"})\
    .select(["full_name", "phone"])\
    .execute()
```
