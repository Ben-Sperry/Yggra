## 6.2 Storage Backend Interface

The Storage Backend Interface (SBI) enables the integration of different storage systems while maintaining consistent behavior and guarantees. This interface allows the system to optimize storage placement without affecting other components.

A storage backend must implement the following core interface:

```python
class StorageBackend:
    def store(self, data: bytes, metadata: dict) -> StorageReference:
        """Store data and return a reference for future retrieval.
        
        The metadata dictionary includes:
        - content_type: MIME type of the content
        - size: Size in bytes
        - hash: Content hash for verification
        - access_pattern: Expected usage pattern
        - sensitivity: Data sensitivity level
        """
        pass
    
    def retrieve(self, reference: StorageReference) -> bytes:
        """Retrieve data using its storage reference.
        
        The system handles caching and access control before calling this method.
        The implementation should focus on efficient data retrieval.
        """
        pass
    
    def verify(self, reference: StorageReference) -> bool:
        """Verify that stored data matches its reference."""
        pass
    
    def delete(self, reference: StorageReference):
        """Remove data from storage.
        
        This is called only after the system ensures no valid references exist.
        """
        pass
```
