# 1. System Overview

## 1.1 Purpose and Vision

Yggra represents a fundamental reimagining of how personal data can be stored, accessed, and utilized across different applications. Drawing inspiration from Wikidata's structure but expanding it for personal computing needs, Yggra creates a universal data fabric that separates data storage from data presentation and usage.

The system's primary goal is to store all personal data in its most atomic, fundamental form within a knowledge graph structure, while allowing different applications to interact with this data through customized interfaces. This approach ensures maximum data reusability while maintaining consistency and eliminating redundancy.

Unlike traditional systems where applications own and manage their data in isolated silos, Yggra inverts this relationship. Applications become specialized lenses into a user's unified data space, similar to how different maps can represent the same physical terrain for different purposes. This paradigm shift enables unprecedented data reuse and interoperability while maintaining strict user control over their personal information.
