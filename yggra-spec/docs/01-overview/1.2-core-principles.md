## 1.2 Core Principles

### Data Atomicity and Immutability
All information in the system is stored as atomic, immutable statements within the graph structure. New information is added but existing information is never modified or deleted. This approach eliminates traditional data management challenges like conflict resolution and version control, while maintaining a complete history of all information.

### Separation of Concerns
The system strictly separates three fundamental aspects of data management:
- Storage: How and where data is physically stored
- Representation: How data is structured and related in the graph
- Presentation: How applications interact with and display the data

This separation allows each layer to evolve independently and optimize for its specific requirements without affecting the others.

### Application Independence
Applications never interact directly with the raw graph data or storage layer. Instead, they declare their data requirements through schema definitions, and the system provides them with appropriate interfaces that match their needed data structures. This approach allows applications to work with familiar data paradigms while leveraging the power of the underlying graph structure.

### Dynamic Data Sharing
Sharing is implemented through controlled, temporary views into the data space rather than through data duplication. This enables fine-grained access control at the property level and ensures that users maintain control over their information even when sharing it with others.
