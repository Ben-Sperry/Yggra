## 1.3 System Context

Yggra operates as a core component of personal computing infrastructure, sitting between storage systems (local storage, IPFS, cloud services) and applications (social media, productivity tools, personal information management). It acts as both a data management system and a data integration platform, enabling applications to work together through shared data while maintaining their independence.

The system is designed to operate primarily in a personal context, where individuals own and control their own data nodes. However, it also supports distributed scenarios through its sharing mechanisms, allowing controlled data exchange between nodes while maintaining privacy and security.
