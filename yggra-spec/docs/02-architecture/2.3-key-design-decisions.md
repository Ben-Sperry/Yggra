## 2.3 Key Design Decisions

### Immutable Graph Structure
The decision to make all graph operations additive rather than modifying ensures:
- Simplified consistency model
- Complete data history
- Easier distributed operation
- Natural support for versioning

### Interface Layer Flexibility
Supporting multiple data structure interpreters allows:
- Easier adoption by existing applications
- Support for various programming paradigms
- Progressive migration paths
- Optimized access patterns

### Storage Layer Abstraction
Abstracting storage operations enables:
- Optimal data placement
- Transparent encryption
- Efficient resource utilization
- Future storage technology adoption

## 2.4 Architectural Constraints

The architecture operates under several constraints:

### Consistency Requirements
- Graph operations must be atomic
- Statement order must be preserved
- Entity relationships must remain valid

### Performance Boundaries
- View generation must be efficient enough for interactive use
- Query response times must meet application needs
- Storage operations must handle large data volumes

### Security Constraints
- Access control must be enforced at all layers
- Data privacy must be maintained during sharing
- Storage encryption must be transparent

### Resource Limitations
- Memory usage must scale with active dataset size
- Storage capacity must be managed across backends
- Network bandwidth must be used efficiently
