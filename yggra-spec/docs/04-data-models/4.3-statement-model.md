## 4.3 Statement Model

Statements are the atomic units of information in the system. Each statement represents a single fact about an entity and is immutable once created. This immutability is key to maintaining consistency and enabling distributed operation.

A statement is formally defined as:

```python
class Statement:
    id: UUID             # Unique statement identifier
    subject: UUID        # Entity this statement is about
    predicate: UUID      # Property being defined
    object: Any          # Value or reference to another entity
    timestamp: datetime  # When the statement was created
    creator_node: str    # ID of creating node
    certainty: float     # Confidence level (0.0-1.0)
    provenance: Dict     # Origin information
    
    # For distributed operation
    vector_clock: Dict[str, int]  # Causal ordering
    signature: bytes              # Creator's signature
```

The statement model ensures:
- Complete history preservation
- Clear provenance tracking
- Cryptographic verification
- Distributed consistency
- Temporal ordering
