## 4.2 Entity-Property Model

The entity-property model defines how information is represented in the graph layer. Unlike traditional database systems where entities have fixed schemas, Yggra entities are defined by their relationships and properties, allowing for flexible and evolving representations.

An entity is formally defined as:

```python
class Entity:
    id: UUID            # Globally unique identifier
    created_at: datetime # Creation timestamp
    node_id: str        # ID of creating node
    metadata: Dict      # System-level metadata
    
    # CRDT sets for multilingual support
    labels: Dict[str, Set[Tuple[str, datetime, str]]]
    descriptions: Dict[str, Set[Tuple[str, datetime, str]]]
```

Properties are themselves entities, but with special handling:

```python
class Property(Entity):
    domain: Set[Type]    # Valid subject types
    range: Set[Type]     # Valid object types
    cardinality: str     # one|many
    symmetrical: bool    # If true, relationship goes both ways
    transitive: bool     # If true, relationship chains are valid
```

This model enables several powerful features:
- Flexible entity definitions that can evolve over time
- Strong typing through property constraints
- Multi-language support through CRDT label sets
- System-level metadata separation from entity data
