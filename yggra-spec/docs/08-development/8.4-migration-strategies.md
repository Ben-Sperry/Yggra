## 8.4 Migration Strategies

Moving existing applications and data to Yggra requires careful planning to ensure smooth transition while maintaining data integrity and application functionality.

Data Migration follows a staged approach:
1. Analysis Phase
   - Map existing data structures to graph representation
   - Identify data relationships and dependencies
   - Plan privacy and sharing requirements

2. Translation Phase
   - Convert existing data to graph statements
   - Maintain reference integrity
   - Preserve metadata and history

3. Validation Phase
   - Verify data completeness
   - Check relationship consistency
   - Confirm privacy constraints

Application Migration can follow several patterns:

Parallel Operation allows gradual transition:
```python
class HybridDataAccess:
    def get_data(self, id):
        # Try new system first
        try:
            return yggra_view.get_data(id)
        except NotMigrated:
            return legacy_system.get_data(id)
```

Incremental Feature Migration enables staged rollout:
```python
class FeatureManager:
    def use_new_system_for_feature(self, feature):
        return (feature in migrated_features and 
                user_opts_in(feature))
```

These migration strategies ensure continuous operation while moving toward full Yggra integration. The system's flexibility allows organizations to maintain existing workflows while gradually adopting new capabilities.
