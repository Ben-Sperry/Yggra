## 8.3 Deployment Models

Yggra supports several deployment models to accommodate different user needs and organizational requirements. Each model maintains the core principle of personal data sovereignty while adapting to specific contexts.

Personal Deployment represents the simplest case:
- Single user operates their own node
- Data stored locally or in personal cloud storage
- Applications interact directly with the personal node
- Sharing through controlled views to other users

Organizational Deployment supports multiple users while maintaining individual data sovereignty:
- Each user maintains their own graph
- Shared storage infrastructure for efficiency
- Organizational policies applied through view systems
- Centralized management of application deployment

Hybrid Deployment combines personal and organizational needs:
- Personal data remains under individual control
- Organizational data shared through managed views
- Clear boundaries between personal and shared data
- Flexible application deployment options
