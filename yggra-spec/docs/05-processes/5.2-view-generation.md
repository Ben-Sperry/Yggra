## 5.2 View Generation

View generation is the process of creating and maintaining application-specific representations of graph data. This process transforms the atomic statements of the graph into structures that applications can easily consume.

The view generation process begins when an application registers its schema with the system. The schema defines what data the application needs and how it expects that data to be structured. The system analyzes this schema to create an efficient strategy for maintaining the view.

When generating a view, the system:
1. Identifies relevant statements in the graph based on the schema
2. Resolves any reference chains needed to construct the view
3. Transforms data into the required format
4. Applies any specified filters or transformations
5. Caches the results for future use

View maintenance happens continuously as new data enters the system. When the graph receives new statements, the view maintenance process:
1. Determines which views might be affected by the new data
2. Updates only the affected portions of each view
3. Notifies applications if their view has changed
4. Maintains cache consistency
