## 5.5 Storage Management

Storage management continuously optimizes data placement and access patterns while maintaining security and efficiency. This process handles the physical storage of data across different backends.

The storage management process includes:

Placement Optimization:
- Analyzes access patterns
- Predicts future usage
- Balances performance and cost
- Manages storage quotas

Data Migration:
- Moves data between storage backends
- Handles format transitions
- Maintains accessibility during moves
- Updates references automatically

Integrity Management:
- Verifies data integrity
- Manages replicas
- Handles corruption recovery
- Maintains backup consistency

This process operates continuously, adapting to changing usage patterns and system conditions while maintaining strict consistency and security guarantees.
