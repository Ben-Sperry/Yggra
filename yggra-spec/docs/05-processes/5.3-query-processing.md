## 5.3 Query Processing

Query processing transforms application requests into efficient graph operations while maintaining privacy and access controls. This process bridges the gap between application-level concepts and graph-level representations.

The query process follows several stages:

Planning Stage:
- Analyzes the query requirements
- Identifies relevant graph patterns
- Develops an execution strategy
- Estimates resource requirements

Execution Stage:
- Traverses the graph efficiently
- Applies filters and transformations
- Aggregates results as needed
- Handles pagination and streaming

Post-processing Stage:
- Formats results according to view requirements
- Applies privacy transformations
- Validates access permissions
- Prepares response metadata
