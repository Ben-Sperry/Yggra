## 5.4 Data Sharing

The data sharing process enables controlled access to personal data while maintaining privacy and security. This process creates secure, temporary views that other users can access through their applications.

When a user initiates sharing, the system:
1. Creates a new view definition based on sharing parameters
2. Applies specified privacy transformations
3. Generates access credentials
4. Records sharing metadata in the graph
5. Establishes monitoring for access patterns

The shared view maintains several properties:
- Independence: Changes to sharing don't affect the underlying data
- Revocability: Access can be removed at any time
- Granularity: Sharing can be controlled at the property level
- Auditability: All access is logged and can be reviewed
