## 10.2 Evolution Path

The evolution of Yggra will likely follow several parallel tracks as technology and user needs advance. We can anticipate several key developments:

Advanced Privacy Mechanisms might incorporate new theoretical frameworks for privacy preservation. The system could evolve to support homomorphic encryption for computation on encrypted data, allowing applications to process sensitive information without accessing the raw data:

```python
class HomomorphicView:
    def compute_on_encrypted(self, operation, encrypted_data):
        # Perform calculations without decrypting
        result = self.homomorphic_engine.compute(
            operation=operation,
            data=encrypted_data,
            proof=self.generate_validity_proof()
        )
        return result
```

Artificial Intelligence Integration could enhance the system's ability to understand and organize personal data. The system might develop capabilities to:
- Automatically categorize incoming data
- Identify important relationships between entities
- Suggest optimal sharing strategies
- Predict user needs and prepare relevant views

Enhanced Collaboration Features might emerge as the system evolves. Future versions could support sophisticated multi-user scenarios while maintaining personal data sovereignty:
- Federated queries across multiple personal graphs
- Secure multi-party computation for shared insights
- Distributed consensus for shared state
- Privacy-preserving social protocols
