## 1.2 Core Principles

### Data Atomicity
At the foundation of Yggra is the principle that all information must be stored as atomic statements - the smallest possible units of meaningful information that cannot be further decomposed without losing meaning. An atomic statement follows the subject-predicate-object pattern, where each component gains significance only through its relationships with others. For example, "Billy" in isolation carries no information; it becomes meaningful only through statements like "(Entity_123, type, Person)", "(Entity_123, given_name, Billy)", "(Entity_123, attends, School_456)".

This principle is especially crucial because most digital data is inherently opaque - a photo file, for instance, is just a collection of bytes that requires human interpretation to derive meaning. While humans can look at an image and understand "this is a picture of my dog Billy at the beach last summer," computers can only treat it as an opaque binary blob. Yggra bridges this gap by representing everything as entities described by atomic statements. That same photo becomes meaningful through statements like "(Photo_789, contains_subject, Billy_123)", "(Photo_789, location, Beach_456)", "(Photo_789, date_taken, 2023-07-15)", "(Photo_789, storage_reference, ipfs://Qm...)". These atomic statements make the photo discoverable and useful in ways impossible with traditional file storage - it can be found when looking for pictures of Billy, summer activities, beach trips, or any combination thereof, all without requiring human interpretation of the image itself.

This decomposition into atomic statements enables unprecedented flexibility in how information can be queried, combined, and repurposed. When planning a child's birthday party, for instance, the same underlying statements can be used to generate guest lists, track RSVPs, manage dietary restrictions, and coordinate with parents - all without duplicating information. By storing everything as atomic statements, the system can dynamically reconstruct complex information views while maintaining data consistency, enabling granular privacy controls, and ensuring that information remains meaningful even when accessed through different applications or viewed in different contexts.

### Immutability
In Yggra, all atomic statements are immutable - once created, they can never be modified or deleted. Instead of changing or removing information, new statements are added that supersede older ones. For example, if a phone number changes, rather than updating the existing statement, a new statement is added with the current number and timestamp. This means the graph grows by accumulation rather than modification, preserving a complete history of all information changes.

This immutability is fundamental to solving several complex challenges in personal data management. First, it eliminates conflict resolution in distributed scenarios - two devices can never make conflicting changes because changes are always additive. Second, it provides built-in versioning and history - you can see how any piece of information has evolved over time. Third, it enables sophisticated privacy controls - you can share current information while keeping history private, or provide access to specific time periods without revealing later changes.

Consider a child's medical history: Instead of maintaining a single "current" record that gets updated, each piece of information - vaccinations, checkups, medications, allergies - is recorded as a series of immutable statements. This creates an invaluable, tamper-proof medical history that can be partially shared (e.g., just current allergies) while maintaining completeness for future reference.

#### Common Concerns About Immutability

The immutable nature of the graph often raises concerns that are important to address:

**Storage Growth and Costs**
Atomic statements are remarkably compact - a typical statement might be less than 100 bytes. Even a million statements would occupy only about 100MB - a tiny fraction of modern storage capacity. Moreover, the graph stores only the statements about data, not the data itself. For example, when you delete that embarrassing party photo, the photo file itself is truly deleted - only the minimal statements describing its existence remain in your personal history. Given that this is personal information, there are natural limits to how much data a single person can accumulate in a lifetime. Additionally, redundant statements are never duplicated - if the same fact is stated multiple times, it's recorded only once.

**Privacy and Control**
Your personal graph is completely private to you - no one else can access the raw statements. Any information sharing happens through carefully controlled facets that present only the specific information you choose to share. This means your complete history remains private while allowing you to share relevant current information when needed. You maintain total control over what aspects of your information are visible to others.

**Performance**
Users never interact directly with the raw graph - instead, applications use cached facets that contain just the relevant, current information needed for specific purposes. These facets can be efficiently maintained and updated, ensuring snappy performance for day-to-day operations. The historical nature of the graph doesn't impact regular use because applications work with these optimized facets rather than querying historical data directly.

**Application Development**
Developers never need to handle the complexity of immutable statements directly. The Yggra system manages all historical data and provides applications with simple interfaces to the exact data structures they need through facets. This means developers can work with familiar data patterns while the system handles the complexities of maintaining history and consistency.

**Information Management**
Users never see or need to manage the growing graph directly. All interaction happens through applications that present relevant, current information through their specific facets. The historical nature of the graph is invisible during normal use - it simply enables powerful features like history tracking and consistent sharing without requiring any extra effort from users.

### Separation of Concerns

The system strictly separates three fundamental aspects of data management:
- Storage: How and where data is physically stored
- Representation: How data is structured and related in the graph
- Presentation: How applications interact with and display the data

This separation solves several critical problems in personal data management while enabling each layer to evolve independently and optimize for its specific requirements.

#### Storage Layer
The storage layer addresses the challenge of efficiently managing diverse types of data across different storage technologies. By abstracting storage details, the system can:
- Place data optimally based on access patterns (frequently accessed photos on local storage, archival data on cloud storage)
- Handle encryption and backup transparently
- Migrate between storage technologies as they evolve
- Optimize costs by matching storage characteristics to data requirements
- Manage distributed storage across devices and services

For example, when storing a collection of family photos, the storage layer might keep recent photos on local SSDs for quick access, move older photos to cheaper cloud storage, and maintain critical memories with redundant copies across multiple locations - all without applications or users needing to know these details.

#### Representation Layer (Graph Layer)
The graph layer solves the fundamental problem of making personal data meaningful and discoverable by maintaining relationships and context independently of how data is stored or presented. This layer:
- Captures relationships between all pieces of information
- Maintains data consistency through immutable statements
- Enables sophisticated queries across different types of data
- Preserves context and metadata independently of specific applications
- Manages privacy and access control at a granular level

When you take a photo at a family gathering, the graph layer automatically connects it to the event, the people present, the location, and any related communications or plans - creating a rich web of relationships that any application can later utilize.

#### Presentation Layer (Application Interface)
The presentation layer solves the challenge of making complex graph data usable by applications while maintaining data independence. This layer:
- Translates between graph structures and application-specific data formats
- Provides familiar interfaces for different types of applications
- Manages caching and view maintenance for performance
- Handles privacy transformations for data sharing
- Enables multiple applications to work with the same underlying data

For instance, a contact management application might see your social network as an address book, while a photo application sees it as photo tags, and a calendar application sees it as event participants - all working with the same underlying graph data through different presentations.

This separation provides several key benefits:
- Applications can be replaced without losing data or context
- Storage technologies can evolve without disrupting applications
- Privacy controls can be implemented consistently across all layers
- New features can be added at any layer without affecting others
- Different optimization strategies can be applied at each layer

As we'll explore in later sections, each layer implements sophisticated mechanisms to achieve these goals while maintaining the system's overall principles of personal data sovereignty and usability.


### Application Independence

Applications never interact directly with the raw graph data or storage layer. Instead, they declare their data requirements through schema definitions, and the system provides them with appropriate facets - specialized views that present data in exactly the structure each application expects. This fundamental principle enables powerful capabilities while solving several key challenges in personal data management.

#### Facet-Based Interaction
Rather than giving applications direct access to data, Yggra provides each application with a facet - a dynamic, bidirectional view that presents data in exactly the format the application needs. For instance, a contact management application might see data as an address book, while the same underlying information might appear as photo tags to a photo app or as event participants to a calendar. These facets ensure applications can work with familiar data structures while leveraging the full power of the underlying graph.

#### Privacy Through Abstraction
Because applications only see their specific facets, privacy becomes inherent rather than bolted-on. Applications can only access data explicitly included in their facets, making data leakage nearly impossible since applications never have direct data access. For example, a photo organization app might see images and tags but not the detailed location data or personal notes that might be attached to those photos in the graph.

#### Collaborative Data Usage
Multiple applications can work with the same underlying data through different facets, each seeing its own appropriate view without needing to know about each other. When you tag someone in a photo, that connection becomes available to other applications through their facets - the calendar might now suggest them for event invites, or the messaging app might include them in relevant group conversations, all without any explicit coordination between applications.

This independence provides several key benefits:
- Applications can be added or removed without affecting others
- Different applications can have different permission levels
- Data updates in one application are automatically reflected in others
- Users can try new applications without painful data migration
- Applications can focus on their core functionality rather than data management

By mediating all data access through facets, Yggra enables a more flexible, private, and maintainable ecosystem of applications while ensuring that users maintain control over their personal information.

### Dynamic Data Sharing

Sharing is implemented through controlled, temporary facets into the data space rather than through data duplication. Like application facets, sharing facets present carefully curated views of your data to others, but with even more sophisticated control over what is shared and how it can be accessed.

The atomic nature of statements in Yggra enables unprecedented granularity in sharing. Rather than making binary share/don't share decisions about entire files or folders, users can share based on rich semantic criteria. For example, with photos you might:
- Share all photos where a specific friend appears
- Share photos from an event, except those containing certain people
- Share nature photos with location data, but only if they don't include people
- Share all photos with family members while hiding specific metadata
- Share photos with specific people until a certain date

This granular control extends to all types of data. Work documents might be shared through facets that:
- Allow editing until a specific version
- Expire after a set time period
- Automatically revoke access when you leave the company
- Hide specific annotations or metadata
- Maintain privacy of related but unshared documents

The system can even support zero-knowledge proofs, where you prove certain properties about your data without revealing the data itself. For instance, proving you're over 18 without revealing your actual birth date, or proving you have required certifications without exposing the underlying documentation.

All sharing is managed through facets that interact with other users' Yggra instances, ensuring that:
- Shared data remains under your control
- Access can be modified or revoked at any time
- Privacy preferences are systematically enforced
- Changes to shared data are properly synchronized
- Usage of shared data can be monitored and audited

This approach transforms sharing from a potential vulnerability into a powerful tool for collaboration while maintaining personal data sovereignty.
