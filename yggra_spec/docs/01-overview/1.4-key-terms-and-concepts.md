## 1.4 Key Terms and Concepts

### Entity
The fundamental unit of information in the system. An entity is defined by its properties and relationships rather than by arbitrary identifiers. Entities can represent anything from digital objects (photos, documents) to abstract concepts (events, tags).

### Statement
An immutable assertion about an entity, expressed as a triple (subject, predicate, object). Statements are the atomic units of data in the system and can never be modified or deleted, only superseded by new statements.

### Application Interface
A specialized view of the graph data that presents information in a format matching an application's requirements. These interfaces can be implemented as familiar data structures like SQL databases, key-value stores, or file systems.

### Data View
A filtered, formatted perspective of the graph data, created for sharing purposes. Views provide controlled access to specific subsets of data with defined properties and relationships.

### Storage Reference
A pointer to data stored in external systems, along with metadata about its storage location, access methods, and integrity verification information. Storage references allow the system to optimize data placement without affecting how applications access the data.
