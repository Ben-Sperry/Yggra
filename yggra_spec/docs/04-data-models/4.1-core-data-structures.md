# 4. Data Models

## 4.1 Core Data Structures

At the heart of Yggra lies a carefully designed set of data structures that enable flexible data representation while maintaining strict consistency guarantees. These structures build upon each other to create a complete system for representing personal information.

The foundational principle is that all information in the system can be decomposed into atomic statements about entities. These statements, when combined with the property model and storage references, create a complete and flexible system for representing any type of personal data.

Each data structure includes mandatory metadata that enables tracking of provenance, timing, and authorization throughout the system. This metadata is crucial for maintaining security and enabling controlled sharing of information.
