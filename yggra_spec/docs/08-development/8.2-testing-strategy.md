## 8.2 Testing Strategy

Testing applications built on Yggra requires consideration of both the application logic and its interaction with the personal data ecosystem. A comprehensive testing strategy should include several layers:

Unit Testing should focus on application logic independent of data access:
```python
def test_task_priority_calculation(self):
    # Test the application's business logic
    task = Task(due_date=tomorrow, dependencies=3)
    priority = calculate_priority(task)
    self.assertEqual(priority, "high")
```

Integration Testing should verify correct interaction with the Yggra interfaces:
```python
def test_task_creation_and_retrieval(self):
    # Test interaction with the system
    schema = TaskManagerSchema()
    view = system.create_view(schema)
    
    # Create a task through the view
    task_id = view.create_task({"title": "Test Task"})
    
    # Verify it can be retrieved
    retrieved = view.get_task(task_id)
    self.assertEqual(retrieved.title, "Test Task")
```

Privacy Testing should verify that your application respects user preferences:
```python
def test_privacy_compliance(self):
    # Test with restricted permissions
    restricted_view = system.create_view(schema, privacy_level="strict")
    
    # Verify application handles missing optional data
    task = restricted_view.get_task(task_id)
    self.assertTrue(task.handle_missing_properties())
```
