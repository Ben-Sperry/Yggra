# 8. Development and Deployment

## 8.1 Development Guidelines

When developing applications for Yggra, developers should follow certain principles and practices to ensure their applications work effectively within the personal data ecosystem. These guidelines help create applications that respect user privacy while taking full advantage of the system's capabilities.

First and foremost, developers should embrace the principle of data independence. Rather than creating private data stores, applications should declare their data requirements through schemas. For example, instead of creating a custom database for a task management application, you might declare your needs like this:

```python
# Define the data structure you need
class TaskManagerSchema:
    def __init__(self):
        self.requirements = {
            "entities": {
                "Task": {
                    "required_properties": ["title", "due_date", "status"],
                    "optional_properties": ["description", "tags", "priority"]
                },
                "Project": {
                    "required_properties": ["name"],
                    "optional_properties": ["description", "deadline"]
                }
            },
            "relationships": {
                "task_project": ["Task", "Project"],
                "task_dependency": ["Task", "Task"]
            }
        }
```

The system will then provide appropriate interfaces based on these requirements, potentially reusing existing data and relationships from other applications when appropriate.

Developers should also follow these key practices:
- Use the highest-level interface that meets your needs
- Implement graceful degradation when optional data is unavailable
- Respect user privacy preferences in your application logic
- Design for eventual consistency in data updates
- Plan for offline operation when possible
