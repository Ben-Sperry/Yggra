## 3.4 Data Sharing System

The data sharing system enables controlled access to personal data through secure views.

### View-Based Sharing

Shared views are created through a view definition that specifies:
- Included entities and properties
- Access permissions
- Temporal constraints
- Update policies
- Privacy transformations

### Access Control

Access control is implemented at multiple levels:
- View level (what data is accessible)
- Property level (what attributes are visible)
- Operation level (what actions are permitted)
- Temporal level (when access is allowed)

### Privacy Management

Privacy is maintained through:
- Differential privacy techniques for aggregate data
- Property-level access control
- Data transformation pipelines
- Access auditing and revocation
- Secure view implementation
