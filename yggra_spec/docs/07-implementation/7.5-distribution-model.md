## 7.5 Distribution Model

The distribution model in Yggra balances personal data sovereignty with efficient data sharing. The system implements this through several mechanisms:

Node Management handles the distributed nature of personal graphs:
- Each user maintains their own graph node
- Nodes can operate independently
- Nodes can sync when connected
- Privacy is maintained during synchronization

The CRDT implementation ensures consistency:
- All operations are eventually consistent
- Conflicts are resolved deterministically
- History is preserved
- Local operations remain fast

Communication between nodes is secure and efficient:
- End-to-end encryption for all transfers
- Bandwidth-efficient sync protocols
- Partial sync capabilities
- Offline operation support

The system handles various network conditions:
```python
class NodeSync:
    def sync_strategy(self, network_quality):
        if network_quality.bandwidth > HIGH_BANDWIDTH:
            return FullSync()
        elif network_quality.bandwidth > LOW_BANDWIDTH:
            return DeltaSync()
        else:
            return PrioritizedSync()
```

Each of these considerations has been carefully designed to ensure that Yggra can operate effectively in real-world conditions while maintaining its core principles of personal data sovereignty and efficient data sharing.
