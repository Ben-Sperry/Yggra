## 6.1 Application Developer Interface

The Application Developer Interface (ADI) provides a familiar and intuitive way for developers to interact with the system. Rather than requiring developers to understand graph structures or storage mechanisms, the ADI allows them to work with data structures that match their application's needs.

When an application developer wants to integrate with Yggra, they begin by declaring their data requirements through a schema definition. For example, a contact management application might define its needs like this:

```python
class ContactSchema:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the structure needed by the application
        self.structure = {
            "table_name": "contacts",
            "fields": {
                "full_name": {"type": "text", "required": True},
                "email": {"type": "text", "format": "email"},
                "phone_numbers": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "text"}},
                "addresses": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object"}},
                "groups": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "text"}},
                "notes": {"type": "text", "required": False}
            },
            "indexes": ["full_name", "email"],
            "access_pattern": "read_heavy"
        }
```

The system then provides the application with its preferred data interface. For a traditional application expecting SQL access, the system might provide:

```python
class ContactManager:
    def __init__(self, schema: ContactSchema):
        # System creates and manages the database
        self.db = SQLiteInterface(schema)
        
    def query_contacts(self, filters: dict) -> List[Contact]:
        # Developer uses familiar SQL patterns
        return self.db.query("SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE ?", filters)
        
    def add_contact(self, contact: Contact):
        # Changes are automatically synchronized with graph
        self.db.insert("contacts", contact.to_dict())
        
    def update_contact(self, contact_id: str, updates: dict):
        # Updates propagate through the system
        self.db.update("contacts", contact_id, updates)
```
